## Description:
With SPARK, we developed "Safe Pickup and Release for Kids" (S.P.A.R.K.), which is an application that is used by Parents and Teachers to ensure that young to teenage kids are being well taken care of, and teachers and parents constantly being on the same page with their location. With this idea there is a ton of room for improvement. Including things like Student Profiles, for known/allowed pickups, medical information, allergies etc.

## Technologies Used
Bcrypt, Bootstrap, Sequelize, mysql2, node, jquery, handlebars, express, express-handlebars, express-session, and dotenv.
